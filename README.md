PML Course Project on HAR Prediction
This repositoty contains the coursework project for the Practical Machine Learning via Coursera conducted by Brian Caffo, Jeff Leek and Roger Peng of the Johns Hopkins University. The following files have been added to this repository.

I thank the HAR group for providing the data to conduct this analysis and develop the model. The details for the HAR group can be found in http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

1.  PML_Project.Rmd: This contains the R code for training and testing the HAR data for developing the predictive model. This is first executed with "training=T" to generate the predictive model. This is again executed with "training=F" to test the model fit on the test data.
2.   PML_Project_Sub.Rmd: This contains the R code for predicting the classifies on the actual test set provided in this project (PML-testing.csv).
3.   PML_Project_trn.html: This contains the execution of the PML_Project.Rmd in training mode (training=T)
4.   PML_Project_tst.html: This contains the execution of the PML_Project.Rmd in testing mode (training=F)
5.   PML_Project_Submission.html: This contains the execution of the PML_Project_Sub.Rmd for predicting the test set (PML-Testing.csv) data.
